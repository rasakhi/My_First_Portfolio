    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p>
        I am Michael Achumba, a learning and development professional with over five years of experience delivering impactful training programs across the corporate, development, and public sectors.

        My expertise spans project execution, instructional design, and stakeholder engagement, and I am passionate about leveraging technology-driven learning solutions to build capacity, enhance performance, and drive sustainable growth, particularly within the education sector.

    <p>
        Beyond the world of L&D, I am a passionate creative. I am a singer-songwriter with over 20 recorded songs, and music plays a big role in how I connect with people and ideas. I am also a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory; I appreciate how humor and intellect can come together to solve problems and explore complex topics in a fun, relatable way.

        As I continue to grow in my career, I am eager to apply my coding skills to design innovative edtech solutions that will transform learning experiences across Africa.
